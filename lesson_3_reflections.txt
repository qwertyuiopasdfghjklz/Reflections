Q:When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:I would like to use a remote repository when I want other people to see my work, so they can contribute too.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Q:Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A:No, I have to make the update personally.
Q:Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A:fork = another github user's repository -> my github repository;
  clone = any repository -> my local machine repository;
  branche = chain of commits.
 Q:What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
 A:Avoiding merge conflicts.
